# Peksenak Drum Library  
This repository contains the HISE project, scripts, and image files for the Peksenak Drum Library.  
It is currently only available for systems running a 64bit version of Windows.  

## Troubleshooting  
The installer should automatically place all of the system files in the appropriate places. If it doesn't, you can find these files and manually place them in the correct directory.  
`ImageResources.dat` and `AudioResources.dat` should both be placed in:  
`%APPDATA%\Zachary Pierce\Peksenak Drum Library`  

If you need to move the installed samples for any reason, you will need to update the location in the plugin. From the settings dropdown, select:  
`Change Sample Folder Location` and select your new sample location.  

In both of these cases you will need to terminate and re load the plugin for the changes to take effect.  

All of the scripts contained in this project are released under the GPL license.
